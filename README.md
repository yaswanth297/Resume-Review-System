# Resume-Review-System
Resume Review Using Generative AI

## Description
This project utilizes Google's Gemini Pro to analyze uploaded resumes against provided job descriptions. The goal is to provide valuable insights, highlight key skills that may be lacking, and suggest resources for upskilling to better align with the job requirements.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Resume:** Users can upload their resume in PDF format.
2. **Upload Job Description:** Users can upload the job description for the desired position.
3. **Analysis:** The system uses Google's Gemini Pro to analyze the resume against the job description.
4. **Insights:** The tool provides insights into the alignment of the resume with the job description, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
5. **Skills Gap:** It identifies key skills that are lacking or need improvement.
6. **Upskilling Resources:** The tool suggests resources, such as online courses or certifications, to help users upskill in the identified areas.

## Future Enhancements
